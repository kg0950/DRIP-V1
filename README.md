Digitally responsive irrigated plantation is a plant cultivation incubator which tracks the essential conditions for the plant like soil moisture, air humidity, temperature and light intensity. Using pre-fed threshold, the whole system maintains the optimal conditions required by the plant using minimum resources. The whole system is IoT enabled and can be
controlled manually too, using Blynk IoT platform. Artificial intelligence has been
implemented to detect intruders in the enclosure and alert the user.
